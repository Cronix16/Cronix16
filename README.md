#Hi, I'm Cronix!
- I am an ETCTI engineering student specializing in low-level systems programming and cybersecurity.
- I build custom C++ tools to understand how operating system function and how malware exploits them.

#Featured Projects
- I architected a 4-part C++ lab enviroment to understand the complete lifecycle of endpoint attacks, evasion, and detection on Linux systems.
1. C++ Packet Sniffer (https://github.com/Cronix16/cpp-packet-sniffer):
* A raw packet interception tool to monitor incoming traffic an catch malware attempting to communicate with C2 servers.
2. Static Malware Scanner (https://github.com/Cronix16/cpp-mini-antivirus):
* A defensive signature based Antivirus that utilizes dynamic memory allocation to scan files for malicious byte sequences.
3. XOR Malware Crypter (https://github.com/Cronix16/cpp-xor-crypter):
* An offensive tool built to bypass static analysis. It uses bitwise operations to obfuscate payloads, effectively blinding traditional Antivirus scans.
4. Mini Linux EDR (https://github.com/Cronix16/cpp-mini-edr):
* A User-Space runtime hunter. It leverages C++17 'std::filesystem' to monitor the '/proc' filesystem, successfully catching obfuscated fileless malware the moment it decrypts and executes in RAM.

#Core Skills
* Languages: C++, Bash.
* OS Internals: Linux, Windows basic architecture.
* Security Concepts: Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), Obfuscation/Evasion, Packet Analysis, Signature Scanning.
